## Let's Make a Game in Unity!

Hello and welcome to my first tutorial series for Unity! In this series, I’ll teach you how to create a prototype using simple 3D primitives and code to implement basic gameplay mechanics and transform it into a game that's ready to publish.

This is a beginner-focused series and as such, will introduce you to new concepts such as Unity’s collision and coroutine systems with a dedicated article for a more thorough explanation. If you have no idea what that is right now, you’re in the right place!

Along the way, I expect you will find mistakes I've made. I kindly ask that you make me aware of them and ask for further explanation where you see fit. If you'd like to contribute, you can report or fix mistakes yourself because this entire series will be available publicly on GitHub!

# The Game
With that out of the way, let’s talk about the details of the game we'll be building throughout the series. We’ll build a 2D shooter with a beautiful art style (thanks to assets from the Asset Store) and music composed by [Chase Bethea](https://chasebethea.com/), inspired by Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island for the SNES!

The gameplay will be in the style of an enemy wave shooter where the difficulty will rise the more waves you survive. In this context, the difficulty ramps up by increasing the number of enemies, along with their movement speed as you continue. There will be random powerup drops: one that will increase your movement speed, and another that will provide you with a shield that will protect you for one hit.

There will be a short story to give some purpose for the player. We’ll add an intro to the story before the gameplay begins and a story conclusion if the player defeats the final boss wave of enemies. It may not sound like a lot, but if you're a beginner (the audience for this series), there will be a lot to unpack here for such a simple concept game.

An important aspect of developing games that I want to instill for you throughout this series is developing with other people in mind, especially those outside of programming. That can be difficult to do when teaching an individual how to make a game solo. 

I'll do my best to explain why I am taking a particular approach, and how it will help remove extra work for you while providing the tools that a game designer or other non-technical team members need to make adjustments without code modifications.

Of course, we're not finished until the game can be played by others! Once the game is finished, I'll show you how to build the game for multiple platforms and publish it via [itch.io](https://itch.io). Then you can share it with your friends and family to show them what you've learned.
