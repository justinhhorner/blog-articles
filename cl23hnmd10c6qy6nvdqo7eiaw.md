## Learning Level Design (Pt. 3)

I have a short update for you all today to share my progress on the sci-fi building design I started early this month. This is using the default renderer without post-processing effects.

We will be exploring the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) and the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) in future articles and give pros and cons to consider for each when deciding which one to use for a project.

## Adding a Door
I added a door that fits well with the look of the building (again, from Filebase - making life easy). There's a small window we can look through.

## Adding Terminals
Next up, I added three terminals in the center of the room and several near the walls. I scaled these up a bit and added screens above with structure beams holding them up.

## Tubes and Platform
Finally, I added three tubes and a platform for them to sit on. You can see I've added some stairs for access to the platform and also added stairs in front of the terminals centered in the room.

## Summary
We've come to the end of the level design itself. I've learned quite a bit about level design and ways to reuse assets during this process.

I'll continue to use this building for other experiments in Unity, so it will eventually have detailed lighting and some post-processing to make it much more appealing in future articles.

Take care.  
Stay awesome.
