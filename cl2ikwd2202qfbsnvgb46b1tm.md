## Learning Level Design (Pt. 4)

I have a short update on the sci-fi building I've been working on using the standard pipeline in Unity. This is the end of the level design updates for now. I wanted to try the different lighting options in Unity to create a dark atmosphere for the scene.

In the following screenshots, you'll see I've used a point light, area light, and spotlight. I managed to get a look I was happy with using them all.

Okay, no more sci-fi building articles. I'll be back withing some new projects soon.
