## A Change of Scenery

We've made a lot of progress on our prototype. It has the basic mechanics for our tiny tutorial game and now we can focus on making the transition from 3D to 2D. In this article, I'm going to add a beautiful background image to begin forming the look for our game.

Unfortunately, because the art and music are paid assets, I can't share them. However, this is a great opportunity for you to learn about the Unity Asset Store to find the art and music that you want to make this game yours!

## The Unity Asset Store
You've probably heard about the absolute gold mine that is the Unity Asset Store. It's loaded with more assets than you'll ever need. In fact, the artwork for this game was purchased from the asset store for $4.99.

If you want to find some art to use for the player, enemies, pickups, and the background, I would challenge you to see what you can find on the asset store, you can probably find everything you need for free!

## Importing Assets
Importing assets into Unity is incredibly simple. To download and import assets from the Asset Store, open the Package Manager from Window -> Package Manager and switch to "My Assets" from the Packages drop-down at the top of the window. The assets tied to your Unity account will be listed and you can easily download and import them from this window.

If you've already downloaded the assets and want to import them, navigate to the Package Manager window and use the new "+" dropdown and choose to add from option for your file type.

## New Background
I have the assets imported, now let's add a GameObject with a SpriteRenderer. We'll do this quickly by dragging and dropping the background sprite I want to use to the Hierarchy. I'll do some repositioning to get it just right and into view.

## Summary
For now, that's all we need to do to bring in our first 2D art. The game already looks better, and all we've done is add a background. We'll be updating more assets in the following articles. Stay tuned.

Take care.  
Stay awesome
